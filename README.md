 # Supporting Data for ACP Development in Accurate MP2/CBS Energy Prediction

This repository contains the supporting data for the development of Atom-Centered Potentials (ACPs) aimed at improving the accuracy of HF/aDZ to that of MP2/CBS in electronic energy predictions.

The `Data/` contains spreadsheets with reference, base, and ACP-corrected energies for different ACPs. Data are provided for:

- The training set
- The TABS test set
- The Comprehensive test set


The `Geometries/` includes molecular geometries in `.xyz` format for the training and both of the test sets.
